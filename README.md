This is a single page website created using HTML and CSS. All graphics and text used in this site are my own original work  i.e ( the photographs and descriptions featured in the website). 
The webpage presents fictional text information about each of the objects in the collection.
The images have been manipulated using photoshop to fit the theme of the website. 

## context 
This website is about a collection of mystical/ enchanted objects. It designed for a (hypothetical) community that practices and believes in witchcraft and wizardry. The website belongs to a wizard who owns rare enchanted objects and uses his/her website to educate the fellow witches, wizards and believers of the mystics about these
objects by providing them with the usages and effects of these items.
